# Bayesian Coin Flipping 

This a Shiny application that simulates a series of coin flips. Based on the outcomes of the coin flips, the app will show how your posterior belief regarding the true probability of flipping heads shifts as new evidence is collected, variable on the strength of your prior (in this case, that the coin is fair and there is an equal chance of flipping either heads or tails).
